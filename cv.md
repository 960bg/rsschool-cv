## About Me
#### Hello, I'm Mihail Dementev, and I'm studying to be a front-end developer. I study at The Rolling Scopes School. Now I am preparing this summary for one of the course assignments. I intend to successfully complete my training and become a professional developer. Now training is not as easy as expected, but I'm working on it. The profession of a front-end developer turned out to be incredibly exciting for me, here I discovered a whole world of new interesting technologies that I want to quickly comprehend and succeed in it.

## Code Example
 *The challenge is to write a function that takes a string and returns a new string with all the vowels removed.*
```
 function disemvowel(str) {
      const ALPHABET = 'AaEeIiOoUu';
      let newMas = str;
      let returnMas = '';
      let flag = false;

      for (let i = 0; i < newMas.length; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < ALPHABET.length; j++) {
          if (newMas[i] === ALPHABET[j]) {
            flag = true;
          }
        }
        if (!flag) {
          returnMas = returnMas + newMas[i];
        }
        flag = false;
      }
      return returnMas;
    }
